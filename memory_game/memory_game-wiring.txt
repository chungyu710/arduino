Description:
  Electrical wiring for memory_game.ino (for Arduino)


Wiring:
  GND -> PB1 -> pin1
  GND -> PB2 -> pin2
  GND -> PB3 -> pin3

  GND -> 220 ohm resistor -> (-) terminal of red    LED // (+) terminal of yellow LED -> pin11
  GND -> 220 ohm resistor -> (-) terminal of green  LED // (+) terminal of yellow LED -> pin12
  GND -> 220 ohm resistor -> (-) terminal of yellow LED // (+) terminal of yellow LED -> pin13

  GND -> 330 ohm resistor -> (-) terminal of passive buzzer // (+) terminal of passive buzzer -> pin9


Notes:
  PB1, PB2, and PB3 can be physically arranged to resemble that of 
  the red, green, and yellow LEDs for intuive use.
