Description:
  A proximity sensor made from an ultrasonic sensor and passive buzzer.
  The bpm and frequency of the beeps are inversely proportional to the distance 
  between the ultrasonic sensor and the closest object to the sensor.

Wiring:
  GND -> 330 ohm resistor -> (-) terminal of passive buzzer // (+) terminal of passive buzzer -> pin7
  
  Ultrasonic Sensor:
    Vcc pin -> 5V power
    trigPin -> pin10
    echoPin -> pin9
    GND pin -> GND
